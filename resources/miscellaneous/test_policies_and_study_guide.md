Computational Course Test Guidelines & Policies
-----

- The tests could be on any material up to now. Since programming is cumulative, all tests are cumulative. Any material marked as optional or bonus will not be tested.  

- Tests are closed resources - all other people, internet, books, and notes. Looking at any other computer (including your phone) cheating. You'll receive an automatic zero on the test. Other penalties for academic integrity violations are also possible.

- Your computer must in good working order. You must notify the instructor electronically before the start of the test if your computer is not working. If you fail to do that or if your computer stops working during the test, it is up the instructor's discretion to accommodate you. It is best practices to turn-off any updates and notifications during test.

- Tests require Respondus LockDown Browser to be installed on your personal computer.
    +  Please work through the quick start guide [here](http://www.respondus.com/downloads/RLDB-QuickStartGuide-Instructure-Student.pdf).
    - Please install it before hand. Familiarize yourself with it. A sample test will be on Canvas. All tests start promptly. Failure to install the required software could result in a zero for the test.
    - It only works with [Windows and Mac](https://www.respondus.com/products/lockdown-browser/requirements.shtml). 
    - Please take the sample test on Canvas to make sure it works and you understand the constraints of LockDown Browser.

- You'll be using LockDown Browser with a Webcam. Read about it [here](https://web.respondus.com/using-lockdown-browser-with-a-webcam-the-student-experience/).  Make sure your webcam is in good working order.  

- You can __not__ ask questions during the test. Do your best to interpret the question on your own. If you have any questions or concerns, please message Brian on Slack immediately after the test.

- You can __not__ have scratch paper. You can not write thing down during the test.

- You will have one chance to answer each question. You'll not be able to go back to change an answer.  

- Since there are two different quiz time slots, you are not allowed to discuss the quiz in anyway with any one other than Brian. Do not even discuss it among people that take it first. This includes "it was easy/hard/awful/unfair" comments. Absolutely no communication until the following day.

Please reach out to the instructor about any questions or clarifications.

Possible Question Types
-------

- Multiple choice
- True / False
- Write short snippet of code
- Fill in the blank (concept or code)
- Parsons problem (aka, mixed-up code problems)
- Tracing
- Debug code
- Predict value of a variable at different steps
- Other types from this list [here](http://teachtogether.tech/en/#s:exercises)

More effective ways of studying
------

1. Make and use flashcards for concepts and coding problems.
1. Take a coding problem from class or the labs solve it completely on your own by writing the code from scratch. 
    - That means to not looking at any solutions or the Internet.
    - Including fixing all errors and bugs.
    - Only after struggling and hopelessly stuck, seek advice.
    - Double check your solution is correct. Then refactor to be elegant.
1. Given a piece of code:
    1. Mental walk through it. Understand the control flow and state of all variables. Predict the outcome.
    2. Double check your intuition with Python Tutor.
    3. Start with your own code. 
    4. Then do the same process with my code. I have lots of code laying around if you want more examples.
    5. Finally, do the same process with other high quality code. An example is [here](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/master/ipynb/Advent%202017.ipynb)
1. Take a concept from class and create a [mind-map](https://www.mindmapping.com/) / [concept-map](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/05-memory/index.html).
    - There is a related idea called the [Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/).
    - Double check your mind-map. Correct errors in your understanding.

Less effective ways of studying
------

1. Reviewing notes without taking any action.
2. Reviewing with classmates (since you will be taking the quiz independently).
1. Not studying.
2. Cramming at 8:45.
